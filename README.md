I liked the layout online. Not finished (there is no hamburger in the mobile version) adaptive layout minimum screen width 320px maximum unlimited. 
There are 3 static html pages. The pages are partially linked to each other. Minimal interactivity is also implemented using JS based on the JQuery library.
